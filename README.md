# Recognizing Hand-Written Digits Using Python
An example showing how Scikit-learn can be used to recognize images of hand-written digits in Python. Done for a presentation on Machine Learning techniques on modern scripting languages.

The project uses a dataset of 1797 sample images of hand-written digits to train a Support Vector Classifier. After the classifier is fed all but the last 10 digits of the data, it is able to recognize the remaining 10 hand-written digits successfully.
